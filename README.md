# EVA4-S7
This repo has notebook and libraries for S7 assignment - CIFAR10

The main notebook
There are libraries created for:
* reading in the CIFAR 10 dataset, set up data loaders for train and test
* net architecture
* training
* testing
* computing class level accuracy

There were issues faced in this assignment with colab:
files uploaded would not be immediately refreshed, needed to restart kernel each time

Opportunities for improvement:
* batch size
* tweaking the network (this time it was not the focus. splitting up the files took enormous time)
